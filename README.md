# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding*

Submitted by: **Therese Elvira Mombou Gatsing**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **30** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Color Feature:
        I experimented with adding vibrant colors to the design. I started with a pink button but switched it to the game card hover for a better effect. To create a cohesive feel, I introduced green accents and focused on making the hover effect more dynamic:

         - Enhanced .game-card:hover with a vibrant pink glow

         - Added smooth transform and transition effects

         - Updated buttons with more pink and subtle green accents

         - Applied mint green for contrast and a pink-tinted shadow to images

         - Finished with a pink star next to game titles for a fun touch

* [x] Animating Tentacle:
        To add more life to the website, I animated the tentacles to create a floating, organic movement, enhancing the visual appeal of the design.

* [x] Shaking Cards:
        I added a shake animation to the game cards when they are selected, giving the interface a playful, interactive feel.
    
* [x] Search Bar:
        I added a search bar to allow users to easily search for specific games within the collection.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges and made many design decisions that shaped the final result:

    *   Animating the Tentacles:
            I wanted to bring more life to the page, so I decided to animate the tentacles with a floating effect. This required a lot of research and trial and error to make the animation smooth and natural.

    *   Shaking Game Cards on Hover:
            My original idea was to have a short video preview of each game appear when hovering over a card. However, I ran into two major issues: I didn’t have actual videos to use, and implementing a card rotation or fancy animation to simulate that effect proved too tricky. As an alternative, I decided to give the cards a shake or vibrate animation on hover to keep it fun and interactive.

    *   Color Customization:
            I experimented with different color combinations to make the site feel more vibrant. Initially, I used shades of blue, then introduced pink to the buttons, but it didn’t feel right. Eventually, I enhanced the card hover effect with pink and added subtle green accents for contrast and cohesion. I had to carefully balance the color palette and gradients. In the end, I added a pink star next to the title for a playful final touch.

    *   Search Bar Placement:
            I wasn’t sure where to place the search bar. I first tried placing it near the header, but it disrupted the visual flow. I finally decided to place it directly under the three filter buttons. Although it requires users to scroll, this placement preserved the overall layout and visual harmony of the site.

    *   Learning Curve:
            Many of the visual effects, like animations and advanced CSS styling, were new to me. I had to do a lot of documentation reading and experimentation to figure out how to implement them properly.
